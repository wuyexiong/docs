# 20220526今天周四局部多云

局部多云:cloud:,28 ℃, 湿度82%, 体感温度34 ℃, 风速 12.9 km/h, 南风

乌龙了，昨晚回去之后才发现，骑行裤的尺码拿错了。  
由于周五要团建，今天天气预报晚上大雨，外国朋友们周六就穿队服去BBQ了，  
所以决定今天中午把错码的衣服拿去换(还)。


### 前情提要 

借助工具即可很好地跟外国友人交流 😄

```
Oh ，sorry .I got the wrong size of Bib。 The final order. my Bib size is L,but I took back the Xl size[捂脸]
Can I take my Bib to be changed tomorrow? is that ok？

yes of course you need to change it otherwise someone will miss his XL one... [捂脸]

thank you， goodnight[月亮]
```

```
Hey Jacky, goodmorning, I understand you took the wrong bib right? 
Could you let me know when you returned it? Then I pick up [愉快]

[愉快]
The sooner the better?
But what time are they in the Bodychefs ?

You mean opening time?

I asked Paul.
Noon time is OK.
I'll return it after lunch.
From Futian.

Ok 👍 no worries 😉 

My wrong size Bib has been returned [抱拳] (13:11)

### **骑行记录**

但是今天是真的热，大中午从福田骑到蛇口再骑回来，眼睛都被晒痛了。  
没带袖套，感觉手臂又黑了一圈，糟糕😰~
